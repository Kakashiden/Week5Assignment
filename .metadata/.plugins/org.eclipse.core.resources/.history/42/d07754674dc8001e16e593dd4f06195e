/*

Note:  The SpacedLogger should add a space or " " between each character of the String argument passed into its methods.


a. If the log method received “Hello” as an argument, it should print H e l l o

b. The error method should do the same, but with “ERROR:” preceding the spaced out input (i.e. ERROR: H e l l o)
